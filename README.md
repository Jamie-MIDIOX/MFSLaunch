# MFSLaunch
A Launcher and Splash Screen for Microsoft Store installs (i.e. not Steam) of Flight Simulator 2020 (for Windows 10).

The C++ source code is based on and derived from the MSFS SDK tool: **fsdevmodelauncher**.  
It will build on the Visual Studio 2019 community release.  An Inno Setup installer is also provided.

The application opens a configure dialog allowing several options including a Splash Screen and Fast Launch.
