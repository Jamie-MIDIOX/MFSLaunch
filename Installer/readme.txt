If you want to uninstall: right-click the Windows Start button and choose "Apps and Features". Scroll down to MFSLaunch and then choose to [Uninstall].

If you want to get the configure dialog back after dismissing it, navigate to the MFSLaunch program folder (Default: C:\Utilities\MFSLaunch), and edit MFSLaunch.ini with a text editor (Notepad).  Edit the line: "NoAsk=1". Delete it or set it to "NoAsk=0".  The next time you run the launcher is will open the configure dialog.

If you want to use a custom Splash screen, edit MFSLaunch.ini, and change the entry, "Splash=MFSLaunch.dib" to "Splash=<custom filename and/or path>".  The image must be a .BMP or .DIB.
